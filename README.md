# Thinkpad T470 OpenCore
 
 ## J.S.Y.K. this project is a unmantained fork from (https://github.com/Ziimmie/Thinkpad-T470-Opencore)
 
 My Opencore folder, for my ThinkPad T470 (i5-7300u, 8GB RAM)

Most of the files in the ACPI folder are for YogaSMC. (https://github.com/zhen-zen/YogaSMC) I don't think all of the files are needed, so feel free to mess around with what works with YogaSMC and what doesn't.
